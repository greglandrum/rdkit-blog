title: Setting up an environment to make Python contributions to the RDKit

**Updated 28.11.2024**

It has been tricky to contribute code or documentation to the RDKit if you're a Python programmer who doesn't want to deal with the complexities of getting an RDKit build working. We want to make it straightforward for people to contribute, so I'm working on some recipes to make thigs easier. This is an attempt at that.

In order to fix bugs or add features in Python you need to be able to clone a local fork of the RDKit from github, modify the code in that local clone, and then run the local code in order to test it. The problem is that most RDKit functionality requires some binary components that need to be built from C++ and installed in the appropriate places. We're going to work around that problem here by copying the binary components from a recent binary distribution of the RDKit into a local clone of the RDKit repo.

I'm going to explain each of the required steps, but the complete set of steps required is at the bottom of this post. Assuming that you have the prerequisites (explained directly below), I hope that these will "just work" for you, but one never knows... I'd like to be able to include this in the RDKit documentation, so please me know how it goes if you try the recipe out. Please do not add a comment to this blog post, I've created a [github issue](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues/3052) so that we have the comments in one place. If you don't have a github account, please email me your comments and I'll add them to the issue.

# The steps explained

These instructions should work on linux, the Mac, and Windows. I've tried to indicate when there are differences between platforms. If I missed something, please let me know in the [github issue](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues/3052).

Prerequisites:

- you need to have either anaconda python or miniconda installed and in your path
- you need to have git installed and in your path
- **On Windows**: these instructions assume that you are running in git bash (or some other capable bash-type shell). I'm sure you can do all of this in powershell, but I haven't managed to figure that out.

You should start by changing into the directory where you want to clone the RDKit source repository and then running:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit.git
```

That will clone the repo from github into a local directory called rdkit. We now change into that directory and use it to set our RDBASE environment variable:

```
cd rdkit
export RDBASE=`pwd`
```

The next step is to create the conda environment that we're going to use to hold the RDKit binary components and install the most recent version of the RDKit into that environment:

```
conda create -y -n py312_rdkit_beta python=3.12
conda activate py312_rdkit_beta
conda install -y -c conda-forge rdkit pytest
```

If you have `mamba` installed, you can use that instead of `conda` in the `create` and `install` commands to have things run more quickly.

These instructions set up an environment using python 3.12; feel free to change that if you'd prefer another python version. You will need to adjust the path below.
If you have other Python packages that you'd like to work with, go ahead and install them into the environment now.

Next we copy the RDKit binary components from that environment into our local clone of the RDKit repo.

On Linux and the Mac you can do this as follows:
```
cd $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.12/site-packages/rdkit
rsync -a -m --include '*/' --include='*.so' --include='inchi.py' --exclude='*' . $RDBASE/rdkit
```
NOTE: that rsync command should be one long line.

On Windows that's:
```
cd $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.12/site-packages/rdkit
find . -name '*.pyd' -exec cp --parents \{\} $RDBASE/rdkit \; 
cp Chem/inchi.py $RDBASE/rdkit/Chem
```

Finally we set our PYTHONPATH and then test that everything is working by importing the RDKit's Chem module:

```
export PYTHONPATH="$RDBASE"
cd $RDBASE/rdkit
python -c 'from rdkit import Chem;print(Chem.__file__)'
```

That last command should not generate errors and should show you a filename that is in your local github clone. As an example, I started the first step of this process in my /scratch/rdkit_devel directory, so I see:
```
/scratch/rdkit_devel/rdkit/rdkit/Chem/__init__.py
```

On Windows I am working in my Code/rdkit_tmp directory, so I see:
```
c:\Users\glandrum\Code\rdkit_tmp\rdkit\Chem\__init__.py
```

# Running the tests
If you're planning on making an RDKit contribution, it's important to know how to run the Python tests to make sure that your changes work and don't break anything else. The RDKit uses pytest to run its python-based tests. For example, if you want to run all of the python tests you would do:

```
cd $RDBASE/rdkit
pytest
```

That will take a while and generate a lot of output, including things that look like exceptions and errors, but should finish with something like:

```
================================================== 715 passed, 15 skipped, 1 warning in 25.48s ==================================================
```

If you just want to run the tests for the `rdkit.Chem` module, you can do:
```
cd $RDBASE/rdkit
pytest Chem
```
For more fine-grained control over which tests run, take a look at the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/usage.html).


# Finishing up
You're set. The one thing to remember is that whenever you want to use this environment in a new terminal window or shell, you need to activate the py312_rdkit_beta conda environment (don't delete it!), set RDBASE, and set your PYTHONPATH:

```
conda activate py312_rdkit_beta
cd your_local_rdkit_clone  # <- replace this with the real name of the directory
export RDBASE=`pwd`
export PYTHONPATH="$RDBASE"
```

# The recipe
Here's the complete recipe for linux and the Mac:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit.git
cd rdkit
export RDBASE=`pwd`
conda create -y -n py312_rdkit_beta python=3.12
conda activate py312_rdkit_beta
conda install -y -c conda-forge rdkit pytest
cd $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.12/site-packages/rdkit
rsync -a -m --include '*/' --include='*.so' --include='inchi.py' --exclude='*' . $RDBASE/rdkit
export PYTHONPATH="$RDBASE"
cd $RDBASE/rdkit
python -c 'from rdkit import Chem;print(Chem.__file__)'
```
and for Windows:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit.git
cd rdkit
export RDBASE=`pwd`
conda create -y -n py312_rdkit_beta python=3.12
conda activate py312_rdkit_beta
conda install -y -c conda-forge rdkit pytest
cd $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.12/site-packages/rdkit
find . -name '*.pyd' -exec cp --parents \{\} $RDBASE/rdkit \; 
cp Chem/inchi.py $RDBASE/rdkit/Chem 
export PYTHONPATH="$RDBASE"
cd $RDBASE/rdkit
python -c 'from rdkit import Chem;print(Chem.__file__)'
```
