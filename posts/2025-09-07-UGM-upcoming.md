The 2025 RDKit UGM takes place next week (September 10-12, 2025) in Prague. 
The github repo is here: [https://github.com/rdkit/UGM_2025](https://github.com/rdkit/UGM_2025).

The UGM is "sold out", so we can't accept any last-minute registrations, but we will be live streaming it over zoom. I will be posting the links to the zoom sessions in the repo as well as in the [UGM discord server](https://discord.gg/5cAr6x66Ug).

The upcoming meeting is my official excuse for why there is no real blog post this week (I also took a few days off to run an ultra-marathon, but I'm not allowed to use that as an excuse for skipping a blog post. ;-)). Hopefully I'll manage to put something real together next week after the UGM.
